# Design_Build_an_Effective_Evaluation_and_Monitoring_Solution-Innovative-Design-within-an-SoC


I had to handle a client network; therefore, I designed and built an effective evaluation and monitoring solution for my Client. As a network security evaluation specialist (or an SoC specialist), I have analysed, elucidated, and addressed those issues below, which was raised by my client.

 
·         The network (shown in design on top of my reports), represents a client network that I was called to handle. My role, as a network security evaluation specialist, is to help the client design and build an effective evaluation and monitoring solution. My client has specific requirements that need to be met and expects me to address some of the technical and legal challenges involved. The client owns all the data created, processed, stored, and communicated on the networked systems, some of which is sensitive.

 
·         The network above is designed such that various services are spread out on server farms. The three servers’ farms host server nodes vie respective gateway nodes numbered 4, 5 and 6. Gateway nodes 10-15 connect to client nodes (several hundred) distributed across subnets.
 
 
·         The nature of service traffic is a combination of web services (for external customer enquiries and e-commerce), and various application services for use within the organisation. Some of the services need to be accessible from the outside world.
 
 
·         The nodes are diverse in their configuration and with different levels of access to services and the outside world
(internet) which is accessible by gateway node 1. Nodes 2, 3, 7 and 8 serve the purpose of intermediary routing within the network. Node 9 is a series of APs providing WiFi networking to the offices.
 
 
·         The client is involved in innovation and product development within the defence and security sector serving clients ranging from government departments, multinational firms, and foreign agencies. The nature of the activity lends itself to sabotage and intellectual property theft. The collaborative nature of the organisation also means that it hosts development teams from other partners from a variety of countries.
 
 
·         My role was specific deliverables and I had asked to prioritise the activities (set out in the questions by my client) detailed below. I had a few weeks to present a report to the technical leadership of the client on these matters.
 
 
N.B - For the sake of consistency, in my answers, specific locations were referred to by the labels used above. I tried wisely to label and help clarify particular locations that I referred to including particular interfaces on the firewall, routers (as there are multiple), links between routers and switches and so on.
 


Questions from my client are below:
 
 
Question 1 (Detecting reconnaissance):
 
The client is particularly vulnerable to insider attacks including sabotage (disruption and destruction) and
espionage (stealing sensitive information). To detect any such attacks, it is important that the client has
effective measures in place.
 
They have asked to evaluate the level of exposure for servers from insiders. Of particular interest here is a network
reconnaissance (scanning) activity that originates internally.
 
 
Question 2 (Statistical Data collection):
 
Session data and statistical data are two types of data of standard form that is collected over networks. Discuss
both forms of data briefly and present a justification for the collection of each. How could each type of help specialist understand whether the potential intrusion is taking place?
 
Figure 1 (design on top of my reports) identifies three locations of strategic interest for collecting statistical data. Justify specialist’s choice. Describe
what tools and configuration the specialist will use for collection?
 
 
Question 4 (The rest of the business):
 
Any changes specialists make will have an impact on the rest of the business and that change has the potential to be both negative and positive. The client uses ITIL as its ITSM framework and is concerned that any changes made will comply with that. Discuss how the use of ITIL in the client affects what specialists are suggesting is implemented, showing how the use of ITIL can help specialist’s system and how specialist’s system can help the client better implement ITIL. The specialist’s answer should be aimed at the IT team and should indicate what parts of the ITIL processes are impacted.
 
The specialist may use ITIL3 or ITIL4, but your answer should clearly state which one is used.
 
 
Question 5 (Advanced persistent threats (APTs)):
 
After devising the specialist’s monitoring solution, the specialist has asked to demonstrate how effective it is. Consider the
following three issues:
 
·         What kind of testing would you recommend in order to determine if the system is working accordingly to specifications and goals? Explain types of tests to be performed, who should conduct them, where, and when?
 
·         Are there any concerns that the company should think of with respect to the qualifications of the testers? Review through the kind of certification, knowledge base and toolset experience would you look for to ensure that the testers are up to the job?
 
·         APT attacks are an increasing threat. What mechanisms of your proposed monitoring system would address these particular threats? Give some description of the kind of APT behaviour you may observe and how your monitoring deployment could detect or prevent it.
 
 
Question 6 (Cost-effectiveness):
 
Security, be it in terms of equipment, human effort, or inconvenience, has a cost. Fact! Security, therefore,
involves trade-offs. Another fact!
 
Specialist’s recommendations, in your answers for questions 1, 2, 3 and 5, entail significant costs in terms of:
 
a)	equipment, including hardware, software and training resources,

b) human, including manual configuration and steering of monitoring operations, and training,
and

c) Inconvenience, in terms of disruption to normal operations.
