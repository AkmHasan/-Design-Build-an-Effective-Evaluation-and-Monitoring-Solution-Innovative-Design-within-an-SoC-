# Design_Build_an_Effective_Evaluation_and_Monitoring_Solution-Innovative-Design-within-an-SoC


I had to handle a client network; therefore, I designed and built an effective evaluation and monitoring solution for my Client. As a network security evaluation specialist (or an SoC specialist), I have analysed, elucidated, and addressed those issues below, which was raised by my client.

 
Â·         The network (shown in design on top of my reports), represents a client network that I was called to handle. My role, as a network security evaluation specialist, is to help the client design and build an effective evaluation and monitoring solution. My client has specific requirements that need to be met and expects me to address some of the technical and legal challenges involved. The client owns all the data created, processed, stored, and communicated on the networked systems, some of which is sensitive.
